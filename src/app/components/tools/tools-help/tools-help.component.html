    This page allows you to perform certain maintenance tasks for the selected
    program.
  </p>
  <p>
    Use the Import Players button to import players from an Excel spreadsheet
    into the current program. The spreadsheet must be in the correct format. New
    players will be added to the database, and existing players (based on name
    and date of birth) will be moved into the current program.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once evaluations have been entered, you can process them to calculate player
    evaluation scores. Each time you process evaluations, the score and looks
    for each player will be updated and replaced.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once evaluations have been processed, you can auto-assign players to teams.
    This will assign players to teams based on their evaluation scores. Players
    are assigned in descending order of their evaluation score, from the first
    team to the last team. In the next pass, the team order is reversed. This
    continues until all players have been assigned to a team. Each time you
    auto-assign players to teams, the team rosters will be cleared first.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can also remove all players from teams. This will remove all players
    from all teams, but will not delete the teams themselves. This will also
    remove all coach assignments.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, you can reset the program. This will remove all players, teams,
    evaluations, and coach assignments. This will not delete the program itself.
    Please note that this operation cannot be undone.
