    This page allows you to manage players in the current program, as well as
    players who are not currently assigned to a program.
  </p>
  <p>
    Click the Add New Player button to create a new player. When creating a new
    player, the next tryout number availabe in the program will be automatically
    assigned to the player, but can be changed if necessary. There is a checkbox
    that is checked by default to add the player to the current program after
    creation. Each player must have at least one guardian assigned to them
    before they can be added. The coach dropdown for each guardian will
    determine which guardians can be selected as coaches for each team.
  </p>
  <p>
    After adding players, they will appear in the grid. Toggling Show unassigned
    players on allows you to see any players who are not currently assigned to a
    program. You can assign these players to the current program either one at a
    time by clicking the Add/Remove icon for the player, or by checking the
    Select checkbox for multiple players, then clicking the Assign Selected
    Players button.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please take care to only add players to the current program who are actually
    participating in the program. Players who are not in the program but are
    added will not be available to other commissioners to add to their programs.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can filter the grid by searching for a player by name or by selecting a
    team, or a combination of both. You can also sort the grid by clicking on
    the some column headers.
  </p>
  <p>You can edit or delete players by clicking on their row in the grid.</p>
  <p>
    Clicking the Clear Program Players button will remove all players from the
    program and delete all evaluations. This must be done at the end of a season
    in order to release players to be added to another program for the next
    season.
