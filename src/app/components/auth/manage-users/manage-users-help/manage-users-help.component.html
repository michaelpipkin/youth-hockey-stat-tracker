    This page allows you to manage users. You can assign a role to each user and
    approve or disapprove users to give or remove app access.
  </p>
  <p>Each new user must be assigned a role before you can approve them.</p>
  <p>
    The app requires at least one active administrator at all times. You may not
    change the role of the last active administrator. You also may not
    disapprove the last active administrator.
  </p>
  <p>
    You may not disapprove your own account. Another administrator must
    disapprove your account for you.
  </p>
  <p>
    If there is another active administrator and you change your own account
    role to Commissioner, you will be automatically logged out and will need to
    log back in.
